## Cleaning Data

## Description:
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete
data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential
part of data analysis. 

## Key Concepts and Challenges:
Data Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the

cleaning process.
Missing Data Handling: Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making
informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset.
Duplicate Removal: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data
uniqueness.
Standardization: Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.
Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model
performance.
